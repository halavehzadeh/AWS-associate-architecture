# Understanding the Challenge

There is a requirement to deploy Sample Application for production.
Some of the steps include:

- Provision Servers
- Take care of High-Availability
- Take care of scalability (auto-scaling)
- Configuring application environment
- OS Updates
- Security

AWS Lambda is a *serverless compute service* that lets you run code without
provisioning or managing servers.
