Positive:

“This was such a beautiful book. I wasn’t even planning any travel when I came across this and just started flipping through the pages. I really like the cover and all the large glossy photographs in this book. John Smith did a wonderful job with the photography. I’ve found a perfect home for this on my coffee table. I’m planning a trip to Paris and Barcelona soon and I know this will come in handy. In the meantime, it’s perfect for assisting this armchair traveler!”

Negative:

“I just wanted to find some really cool new places such as Seattle in November. I’ve never visited before but no luck here. Some of these suggestions are just terrible… I had to laugh! Most suggestions were just your typical big cities, restaurants and bars. Nothing off the beaten path here. I don’t want to go these places for fun. Totally not worth getting this.”
