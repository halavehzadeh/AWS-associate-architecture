# Well Architected Framework

## Overview of the framework
knowledge portal
The Well-Architected Framework has been developed to help cloud architects build secure,
high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications.
The framework is designed with five pillars in consideration, namely:
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- ost Optimization

## Pillar 1 : Operational Excellence
knowledge portal
Focuses on running and monitoring systems so provide business value.
Design principles:

- Perform operations as code.
- Annotated Documentation
- Make frequent ,small, reversible changes.
- Refine Operations procedure frequently.
- Anticipate failure.
- Learn from operational failure.

## Pillar 2 : Security
knowledge portal
Focuses on on protecting information & systems.
Design principles:
- Implement a strong identity foundation.
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers.
- Automate security best practices.
- Protect data in transit and at rest.
- Keep people away from data.
- Prepare for security events.

## Pillar 3 : Reliability
knowledge portal
Focuses on the ability to prevent, and quickly recover from failures to meet business and
customer demand.
Design principles:
- Test Recovery Procedure.
- Automatically recover from failure
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

## Pillar 4 : Performance Efficiency
knowledge portal
Focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently.
Design principles:
- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Mechanical sympathy

## Pillar 5 : Cost Optimization
knowledge portal
Focuses on avoiding un-needed costs.
Design principles:
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on data center operations
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
- Anticipate failure.
- Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership
