# Cloud Computing Characteristics

## Important Characteristic

There are 3 important characteristic of Cloud Computing.

1. On-Demand and Self Service [Resource available whenever you need]
2. Elasticity [Resource capacity can grow and shrink based on demand]
3. Measured Service [Pay for what you use]

## 1 - On-Demand and Self Service

The appropriate cloud resource can be provisioned whenever user needs.
Example:
On 25th December at 12 AM, E-Commerce Corp needs Server with 100 GB
RAM, 24 core CPU and 10 TB of storage space.

## Characteristic 2 - Elasticity

The Cloud computing resource should be able to scale up and scale down
based on requirements.
Example:
Small Corp is running server with 4 GB RAM and 2 Core CPU.
Tomorrow, Small Corp wants to SCALE UP server to 12 GB RAM.
Day after tomorrow, Small Corp wants to SCALE DOWN to 1 GB RAM.

## Characteristic 3 - Measured Service
Cloud provider monitors how much of a particular service each customer
consumes within a designated time period.
Example:
‚óè Small Corp has launched a new server with 4GB RAM capacity for 28
minutes post which it got terminated.
Small Corp will be charged only for 28 minutes.
