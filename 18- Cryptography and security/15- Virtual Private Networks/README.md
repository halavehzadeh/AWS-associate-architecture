## VPN And Encryption

VPN is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network.
It prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the
user to conduct work remotely.

## VPNs in Corporate Environments

In organizations, most of the servers are in the private subnet where direct

Users can only connect to them through Organization’s VPN.
